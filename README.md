# Hung Tran

- 👋 I am a recent graduate with a major in Computer Science from Rutgers University-New Brunswick. My passion lies in web technologies, machine learning, and everything in between. This enthusiasm has driven me to acquire expertise in frontend technologies like React, Redux/Zusand, Material-UI, and TypeScript, as well as backend technologies such as Spring Boot, Flask/FastAPI, NestJS/Express, and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I have gained proficiency in machine learning through tools like PyTorch and Pandas.

- 📚 During the past three summers, I had the opportunity to apply my skills in both frontend and backend development while working as a software engineering intern at VinBrain, VinBigData, and EOG Resources.

- 👨‍💻 I am eager to embark on a career as a software engineer, with a particular interest in roles that encompass full-stack development, backend engineering, frontend development, or machine learning. You can explore my portfolio at https://metoonhathung.github.io/ to see some of my previous projects. I am actively seeking new graduate positions in these fields. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please don't hesitate to reach out.
